Our solution is an AI-powered career recommendation and job-matching platform that helps students and professionals make smarter career choices. The platform analyzes a user’s profile — including their education, skills, interests, and work experience — and recommends the most suitable career paths and job opportunities.

Unlike traditional job portals, which only list available positions, our system goes deeper by providing:

Personalized job recommendations aligned with market demand.

Skill gap analysis, highlighting what users lack for a target role.

Upskilling suggestions, recommending relevant courses or certifications.

Career progression guidance, showing long-term opportunities.

The solution is powered by machine learning models such as Random Forest classifiers and natural language processing (NLP) for skill extraction from resumes. It leverages curated job datasets to ensure recommendations are industry-relevant and future-ready.

This makes career planning data-driven, personalized, and accessible for students, professionals, universities, and career counselors alike.
